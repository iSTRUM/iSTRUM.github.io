Interested in transient rheology or the thermodynamic state of the upper mantle? Then add these iSTRUM-related sessions and abstracts to your calendar!\nSession: Earth’s Transient Behavior Through Synthesis of Observational, Laboratory, and Theoretical Approaches # \u0026ldquo;Earth’s mechanical response to stress can be viewed as a combination of two end-member behaviors (purely elastic, and steady-state viscous) with a third: a time-varying transient response. This transient behavior is essential for accurately capturing phenomena on “broadband” timescales from 10-1 to 1012 s, including seismic attenuation, solid-Earth tides, the seismic cycle, hydrological loading, and post-glacial rebound. In this session we explore a combination of geophysical observations, laboratory observations, and theoretical frameworks that span broad time- and length-scales, with the goal of identifying relationships that explain and predict Earth’s broadband behavior. We invite contributions from the seismology, geodesy, rock mechanics, and geodynamics communities (relevant to any space and timescale!) which shed light on understanding Earth’s transient mechanical behavior.\u0026rdquo;\nE-lightning Session ( program link)\nWednesday, 13 December 2023, 12:20 - 13:50\neLightning Theater VI, Hall D - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\nPoster Session ( program link)\nWednesday, 13 December 2023, 16:10 - 20:30\nPoster Hall A-C - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\niSTRUM-related Presentations # Spatiotemporal Sea-Level Fingerprinting of Meltwater Pulse 1A with Transient Deformation ( program link) Allie Coonin, Harriet Lau, Sophie Coulson Monday, December 11, 11:40 - 11:50\n2005 - West (Level 2, West, Moscone Center)\nA Dynamic Oceanic Asthenosphere Revealed by High Shear Attenuation in the Pacific ( program link) Josh Russell, Colleen Dalton, Chris Havlin, Ben Holtzman, Zachary Eilon, James Gaherty, Don Forsyth\nMonday, December 11, 16:10 - 20:30\nPoster Hall A-C - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\nMelting ice, rising land: unraveling contributions to crustal uplift imaged by Sentinel-1 InSAR in the Kerguelen Islands ( program link) Kristel Chanard, Raphael Grandin, Louis-Marie Gauer, Luce Fleitout\nMonday, December 11, 18:50 - 19:00\n158 - South (Upper Mezzanine, South, Moscone Center)\nTowards Quantitative Understanding of the Effect of Dislocations on Ice Anelasticity: High-Resolution Measurements of Attenuation and Dispersion with a New Cryo-Forced-Oscillation Apparatus ( program link)\nHatsuki Yamauchi, Christine McCarthy, Benjamin K Holtzman, Travis F Hager, David L Goldsby\nWednesday, December 13, 10:30 - 14:50\nPoster Hall A-C - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\nEstimating the Electrical Resistivity of the Upper Mantle with the Very Broadband Rheology Calculator (VBRc) ( program link) Samuel Ofori, Samer Naif, Chris Havlin, Benjamin K Holtzman\nWednesday, December 13, 10:30 - 14:50 Poster Hall A-C - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\n","date":"October 17, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/agu-2023/","section":"","summary":"iSTRUM-related sessions and presentations at the AGU Fall Meeting, 2023","title":"AGU Preview","type":"blog"},{"content":" iSTRUM Meeting Recap # In early September, the iSTRUM team convened its first in-person team meeting to cap off a year full of discussion and collaboration on linking observational geophysics, laboratory experiments and forward modeling to better constrain the role of transient rheology in the deformation of the upper mantle. Over two days at Brown University in Providence RI, team members and a number of invited guests presented their efforts to constrain, observe and model the full spectrum rheology of the upper mantle.\nDay 1 of the meeting included a number of presentations from team members including updates on new deformation experiments on both olivine (Lars Hansen and Diede Hein, U. Minnesota) and ice (Ben Holtzman and Hatsuki Yamauchi, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) as well as approaches to modeling that incorporate more complex constitutive relationships (Harriet Lau, Brown U.). On the observational side, Kristel Chanard (IPGP) presented results from initial efforts to decompose geodetic observations in the western US to identify a signal from transient deformation. Zach Eilon and Cristhian Salas Pazmiño (UC Santa Barbara) presented differential body wave attenuation results from both Alaska and the Western US, and Josh Russell (Syracuse U.) presented his results on the seismic attenuation of the Pacific upper mantle, on which Colleen Dalton (Brown U.) is a collaborator.\nThe second day of the meeting focused on discussion and planning for the main goal of the iSTRUM project in which laboratory, observational and modeling efforts are integrated within a single modeling framework and applied to the selected sites (Western US, Alaska, Iceland). Some of the action items for the upcoming year include developing constitutive equations based on experimental data that can be used within the Very Broadband Rheology Calculator (VBRc); developing strategies for including a more complex nonlinear transient rheology in forward models of GIA and other surface loading problems; modeling glacial isostatic adjustment using the open source geodynamic finite element model ASPECT; and reconciling body wave and surface wave measurements of attenuation in the western US and Alaska. All of these efforts will feed into the main short-term goal of linking seismic, geodetic, lake rebound and GIA data from the western US within an initial pilot study that relies on the updated VBRc to constrain both the thermodynamic state of the upper mantle and the contribution of transient deformation to those observations. The methodology developed in the pilot study will then be applied across the chosen study regions.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in learning more, come find us at AGU!\n","date":"October 1, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/istrum-yr1-recap/","section":"","summary":"iSTRUM Meeting Recap # In early September, the iSTRUM team convened its first in-person team meeting to cap off a year full of discussion and collaboration on linking observational geophysics, laboratory experiments and forward modeling to better constrain the role of transient rheology in the deformation of the upper mantle.

The rate of this flow depends on the properties of the rock, such as its temperature, and on the nature of the contacts between the tiny mineral crystals that comprise the rock. The mantle can be pushed to flow by numerous different phenomena, such as: passing seismic waves after an earthquake; melting of continental ice sheets and glaciers; the annual cycle of groundwater recharge and extraction; and the draining of large lakes. This study uses observations of these phenomena to measure the rock properties and the interactions between mineral crystals in the mantle beneath three locations: the western United States, Alaska, and Iceland. Meanwhile, laboratory experiments are probing how samples of rock deform under controlled conditions. Finally, new computer models are synthesizing the lab and field observations to understand the underlying physical laws that explain the full suite of data. The results of this study have a bearing on topics that range from predicting how sea level will rise due to melting ice sheets to understanding tidal deformation on Jupiter’s moons. Outreach and training are key elements of the project. Four graduate students and six undergraduate students are being educated over the duration of the project. Workshops will bring together researchers from diverse scientific disciplines to learn and debate about the scientific outcomes and the computer tools developed as part of this study.\nThere is emerging recognition that the variables describing Earth’s mechanical response to stress, elastic moduli, attenuation, and viscosity, are all frequency dependent. While the end-member elastic and steady-state behaviors are relatively well understood, there remain many fundamental questions regarding the intermediate transient regime. This study is an integrative research and outreach program that combines observational, laboratory, and modeling efforts to measure Earth’s full-spectrum rheological response and illuminate the underlying microphysical processes. Observational work is characterizing frequency dependent upper-mantle dissipation in three locations (western U.S., Iceland, and Alaska) using seismic and geodetic observations of different frequencies but complementary spatial sampling. Experimental work is investigating how dislocations affect transient creep under different temperature and stress conditions and with variable quantities of melt and secondary solid phases. Modeling work is developing new constitutive laws for transient creep and incorporating more sophisticated rheologies in the viscoelastic deformation code. This study is addressing questions about: (1) the broadband mechanical response of the solid Earth; (2) the microphysical processes that control viscoelasticity; and (3) the implications for inferences of steady-state viscosity from geodetic observations and of thermodynamic state from seismic tomography. Broader impacts include training of graduate and undergraduate students, a synthesis workshop that convenes 120 researchers to outline recent advances in understanding transient rheology and to shape the topics and collaborations that will dictate the next decade of inquiry, and development of interactive Jupyter notebooks that introduce open-source data-science tools in the context of seismic attenuation and transient rheology.\nFunding # iSTRUM brings together researchers from across geoscience disciplines through support of the NSF Frontier Research in Earth Sciences program.
