[{"content":"Researchers at UCSB are focusing on measuring seismic attenuation from teleseismic body waves in Alaska. (“Teleseismic” = from earthquakes that are far away from our sensors, “body waves” = seismic waves that dive deep into the Earth’s interior before coming back up to our stations at a steep angle, in contrast to “surface waves” that roll along the Earth’s surface.) Alaska was chosen by the iSTRUM team as a focus site because it provides a useful combination of Earth forcings at different timescales (including glacial and seasonal) as well as excellent seismological coverage. It also includes a large range in physical characteristics (e.g., temperature, melt) associated with the Pacific-North American plate boundary, that make it an ideal natural laboratory for exploring the relationship among state variables, mechanical behavior, and geophysical observables.\nAll available broadband seismic stations in Alaska between 2013 and 2022. The inset represents all the teleseismic events with magnitudes between 6 and 8 that occurred during the same period of time. Seismic attenuation, or the rate-of-loss-of-seismic-energy, is quantified by the quality factor, \\(Q\\), which describes what fraction of a wave’s energy is lost per wave cycle; higher \\(Q\\) means less attenuation. Since energy is lost each cycle, as the rocks strain one way, then the other, higher frequency waves attenuate more than lower frequency waves (even assuming \\(Q\\) itself is not frequency dependent; we don’t actually assume this but correct for slight frequency dependence observed in lab settings: \\(Q = Q_0 f^{0.27}\\)) because for a given distance traveled, higher frequencies have more wave cycles. This is very useful because it predicts a (roughly) linear dependence of wave amplitude as a function of frequency, where the gradient of the amplitude spectrum is proportional to a quantity called \\(t^\\ast\\), which is itself proportional to attenuation (i.e., \\(1/Q\\)). \\(t^\\ast\\) (pronounced “t-star”) is a canonical measurement of integrated body wave attenuation.\nUCSB grad student Cristhian Salas-Pazmino has measured differential \\(t^\\ast\\), the difference between apparent \\(t^\\ast\\) at different stations, for 14,402 P-waves and 11,297 S-waves, as well as differential travel times for 67,671 P-waves and 114,205 S-waves. P-waves have sensitivity to both shear and bulk attenuation and elastic moduli, while S-waves are sensitive only to shear attenuation and modulus.\nLeft: differential travel time measurements for S-waves Right: differential \\(t^\\ast\\) measurements for S-waves. For illustrative purposes, we defined eight bins with ranges of back azimuths every 45 degrees starting at 0 degrees. The spikes represent the mean value of all the measurements within each back azimuth bin. The measurements are colored-coded by the measured value of differential travel times and differential \\(t^\\ast\\) respectively. In the case of velocity, blue measurements represent fast arrivals and red colored spikes represent slow arrivals or positive values. In the case of attenuation, orange colors and positive values represent high attenuation, and green colors and negative values represent low attenuation. Using these measurements, we have conducted tomographic imaging, building 3-D models of wave speed and attenuation structure beneath the entirety of Alaska. Along the way, we found it necessary to implement significant methodological developments, including multi-frequency travel time measurements for finite-frequency kernels that don’t alias important structural wavelengths, and an iterative inversion for \\(\\delta(1/Q)\\) that allows for significant excursions from a 3-D global starting model. Future imaging improvements will fold in constraints from surface waves (from the Dalton group at Brown) and local body waves (from other collaborators).\nTop: Horizontal slices of our preferred S-wave model for velocity (left), and attenuation (right) at 280 km depth. Bottom: Vertical slices through the velocity (left) and attenuation (right) tomography models, the location of these slices is displayed in the middle panel The final stage of our analysis is to interpret our 3-D maps of shear velocity and attenuation for material properties, chiefly temperature, grain size, and melt fraction. We do this using the VBRc (Very Broadband Rheology calculator). We first pre-compute lookup tables that link seismic properties to these state variables, and then use a multi-stage Bayesian approach (also novel) to quantify the most likely material properties. In detail, we first compute posterior probabilities for state variables at each node in our model space with broad priors, then stitch these point-wise distributions together using a smoothing function in 2-D, then re-compute the posteriors using more narrow priors centered on the smoothed maps. The result is a set of probabilistic maps that simultaneously respect both local and regional constraints on these state variables including temperature (\\(T\\)), melt fraction (\\(\\phi\\)), and grain size (\\(d\\)),\nThermodynamic state of the upper mantle beneath Alaska.

This paleoclimate event, ~ 14,000 years BP, involved a catastrophic 10-20 m rise in global mean sea level, within only 500 years. When ice sheets melt, Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface mass is redistributed across the globe causing the solid Earth to deform.

However, our understanding of broadband rheology implies that even at these fast timescales, deformation is far from elastic.

Over two days at Brown University in Providence RI, team members and a number of invited guests presented their efforts to constrain, observe and model the full spectrum rheology of the upper mantle.\nDay 1 of the meeting included a number of presentations from team members including updates on new deformation experiments on both olivine (Lars Hansen and Diede Hein, U. Minnesota) and ice (Ben Holtzman and Hatsuki Yamauchi, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) as well as approaches to modeling that incorporate more complex constitutive relationships (Harriet Lau, Brown U.). On the observational side, Kristel Chanard (IPGP) presented results from initial efforts to decompose geodetic observations in the western US to identify a signal from transient deformation. Zach Eilon and Cristhian Salas Pazmiño (UC Santa Barbara) presented differential body wave attenuation results from both Alaska and the Western US, and Josh Russell (Syracuse U.) presented his results on the seismic attenuation of the Pacific upper mantle, on which Colleen Dalton (Brown U.) is a collaborator.\nThe second day of the meeting focused on discussion and planning for the main goal of the iSTRUM project in which laboratory, observational and modeling efforts are integrated within a single modeling framework and applied to the selected sites (Western US, Alaska, Iceland). Some of the action items for the upcoming year include developing constitutive equations based on experimental data that can be used within the Very Broadband Rheology Calculator (VBRc); developing strategies for including a more complex nonlinear transient rheology in forward models of GIA and other surface loading problems; modeling glacial isostatic adjustment using the open source geodynamic finite element model ASPECT; and reconciling body wave and surface wave measurements of attenuation in the western US and Alaska. All of these efforts will feed into the main short-term goal of linking seismic, geodetic, lake rebound and GIA data from the western US within an initial pilot study that relies on the updated VBRc to constrain both the thermodynamic state of the upper mantle and the contribution of transient deformation to those observations.

The rate of this flow depends on the properties of the rock, such as its temperature, and on the nature of the contacts between the tiny mineral crystals that comprise the rock. The mantle can be pushed to flow by numerous different phenomena, such as: passing seismic waves after an earthquake; melting of continental ice sheets and glaciers; the annual cycle of groundwater recharge and extraction; and the draining of large lakes. This study uses observations of these phenomena to measure the rock properties and the interactions between mineral crystals in the mantle beneath three locations: the western United States, Alaska, and Iceland. Meanwhile, laboratory experiments are probing how samples of rock deform under controlled conditions. Finally, new computer models are synthesizing the lab and field observations to understand the underlying physical laws that explain the full suite of data. The results of this study have a bearing on topics that range from predicting how sea level will rise due to melting ice sheets to understanding tidal deformation on Jupiter’s moons. Outreach and training are key elements of the project. Four graduate students and six undergraduate students are being educated over the duration of the project. Workshops will bring together researchers from diverse scientific disciplines to learn and debate about the scientific outcomes and the computer tools developed as part of this study.\nThere is emerging recognition that the variables describing Earth’s mechanical response to stress, elastic moduli, attenuation, and viscosity, are all frequency dependent. While the end-member elastic and steady-state behaviors are relatively well understood, there remain many fundamental questions regarding the intermediate transient regime. This study is an integrative research and outreach program that combines observational, laboratory, and modeling efforts to measure Earth’s full-spectrum rheological response and illuminate the underlying microphysical processes. Observational work is characterizing frequency dependent upper-mantle dissipation in three locations (western U.S., Iceland, and Alaska) using seismic and geodetic observations of different frequencies but complementary spatial sampling. Experimental work is investigating how dislocations affect transient creep under different temperature and stress conditions and with variable quantities of melt and secondary solid phases. Modeling work is developing new constitutive laws for transient creep and incorporating more sophisticated rheologies in the viscoelastic deformation code. This study is addressing questions about: (1) the broadband mechanical response of the solid Earth; (2) the microphysical processes that control viscoelasticity; and (3) the implications for inferences of steady-state viscosity from geodetic observations and of thermodynamic state from seismic tomography. Broader impacts include training of graduate and undergraduate students, a synthesis workshop that convenes 120 researchers to outline recent advances in understanding transient rheology and to shape the topics and collaborations that will dictate the next decade of inquiry, and development of interactive Jupyter notebooks that introduce open-source data-science tools in the context of seismic attenuation and transient rheology.\nProject leads # iSTRUM brings together researchers from across geoscience disciplines through support of the NSF Frontier Research in Earth Sciences program.
