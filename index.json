[{"content":"A key goal of the iSTRUM project is to better understand the microphysics of transient creep (i.e., the time-dependent change of a rock’s viscosity after changes in stress) in the upper mantle. However, as we cannot observe the flow of rocks in the upper mantle in situ, laboratory experiments remain key to informing our understanding of its transient rheological behavior. Unfortunately, there are two significant challenges to be overcome when using laboratory experiments to investigate the flow of rocks in the mantle. First and foremost of these limitations is the limitation of time. We simply cannot run experiments that last as long as the geophysical phenomena that the iSTRUM project focuses on, including postseismic creep and glacial isostatic adjustment, which occur over timescales of months to hundreds of years. Another challenge lies in the size of the samples used in our experiments. Many experimental methods rely on small samples to produce the high pressures that are characteristic of the mantle. However, to maintain a representative number of mineral grains in a small rock sample, the average grain size needs to be small (on the order of tens of micron), while the actual grain size of mantle rocks is much larger, on the order of 1–10 mm. Such small grain sizes may be problematic as many of the mechanisms by which rocks deform are sensitive to grain size, and the mechanism that presents the easiest way to deform fine-grained rocks in the laboratory may not be the mechanism that controls the deformation of the coarse-grained rocks in nature.\nAs we cannot perfectly replicate the conditions of the upper mantle in our experiments, we instead aim to tease out the microphysics of deformation from our experiments so that we may confidently extrapolate these physics to geologically relevant timescales and grain sizes. With this philosophy in mind, there (thankfully) are a few experimental \u0026ldquo;tricks\u0026rdquo; that we may apply to get around these time and grain-size limitations. First, we can reduce the time required to reach a geologically relevant amount of deformation by subjecting our samples to high temperatures during experiments, thereby increasing the kinetics of deformation. Second, we can apply high stresses in our experiments to overpower those mechanisms that are primarily sensitive to grain size and study those mechanisms that are primarily sensitive to stress and likely dominate at large grain sizes. Then, by comparing our experimental observations to the predictions of microphysical models we can begin to eliminate those models that fail to capture observations and refine those that match our data well.\nTraditionally, transient creep in the upper mantle has been attributed to diffusion-based models. However, over the past few years, two alternative models have popularized in the scientific discourse that instead aim to explain transient creep in the upper mantle using the motion of dislocations (i.e., linear crystalline defects that facilitate deformation by moving and multiplying in response to stress). As these models predict distinct mechanical behavior, it is important to test if they actually match the behavior of olivine, the most abundant mineral in Earth’s upper mantle. One model, known as ‘the plastic-anisotropy model’, postulates that the plastic anisotropy of olivine (i.e., its directional dependence of the ease of dislocation motion) results in transient creep in mantle rocks. In this model, a stress change in the mantle first induces deformation of grains in easy orientations for dislocation motion leading to a low initial viscosity. With time, the deformation of grains in hard orientations starts to control the long-term behavior of the rock as soft grains alone cannot accommodate all deformation indefinitely. The other model, known as ‘the backstress model’, argues that it is actually the long-range interactions among dislocations and the evolution of the density of dislocations that controls the transient behavior of mantle rocks. The experiments we performed at beamline 6-BM-B of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (described in this recent paper) leveraged both of the aforementioned ‘tricks’, and enabled us to rule out one of the proposed models for transient creep in the upper mantle.\nWe performed high-temperature (900–1200°C), high-pressure (~5 GPa), and high-stress forced-oscillation experiments on polycrystalline olivine in a multi-anvil apparatus called a deformation-DIA. In these experiments we applied a sinusoidal force to our samples. We then used the bright X-rays produced by the APS to measure the deformation (also referred to as ‘strain’) of our samples from digital image correlation of radiographs. We measured the stress that the rock experienced by diffracting X-rays through the crystal lattice of the sample and converting the elastic lattice strains to stresses using Hooke’s law. The time delay between the imposed sinusoidal stress and the measured sinusoidal strain is directly related to a quantity known as the inverse quality factor, Q-1, that is commonly used by seismologists to quantify the attenuation of seismic waves traveling through the mantle after earthquakes. By changing the stress amplitude of the imposed oscillations we were able to observe that Q-1 increased with amplitude (Figure 1), which is diagnostic of attenuation produced by dislocations.\nFigure 1: Positive correlation between attenuation and stress amplitude observed in one of our experiments at 1150°C that featured 4 steps of increasing amplitude, all at a period of 300 seconds. Symbology represents measurements from different lattice planes of olivine and two different olivine samples that were deformed in the same experiment. To confirm that the trend we observed could not be attributed to changes in grain size or crystallographic orientations over the course of our experiments, we characterized the microstructure of our samples before and after deformation by electron backscatter diffraction using a scanning electron microscope. These analyses confirmed that the evolution of grain size and crystallographic orientations could not explain our observations. Therefore, our measurements of Q-1 provide a first-of-its-kind dataset to compare to the predictions of the plastic-anisotropy and backstress models.\nBecause there are no analytical solutions to the constitutive equations of these models, we performed numerical simulations of our experiments, solving the equations for the strain produced by a sinusoidally varying stress. Figure 2 presents a comparison of the attenuation from our experiments to the attenuation predicted by the plastic-anisotropy and backstress models. The comparison clearly illustrates that the plastic-anisotropy model underpredicts the amount of attenuation observed in our experiments, especially at lower temperatures. As such, we conclude that the plastic-anisotropy of olivine did not dominate the behavior of the olivine in our experiments.\nFigure 2: Comparison of experimental data (symbols), and predictions of the backstress and plastic anisotropy models (solid and dotted lines, respectively) at a period (p) of 300 s.

A central goal of the iSTRUM project is to investigate the mantle\u0026rsquo;s frequency-dependent mechanical response to stress. By using Rayleigh waves in the period range 30-150 seconds, we are providing constraints that probe lower frequencies than the body-wave attenuation study (period range ~1-10 sec) and higher frequencies than probed by ocean tidal loading, hydrological loading, and ice melting. The sensitivity of seismic attenuation to material properties such as temperature, grain size, and partial melt content is complementary to shear wave velocity, making maps of attenuation also useful to improving our understanding of subsurface Earth structure. Alaska provides a natural laboratory to investigate the attenuation signature of a variety of geological settings, including active subduction and volcanism. However, obtaining robust images of attenuation can be challenging, because it is difficult to isolate the attenuation signal in Rayleigh wave amplitude observations. We have been conducting tests with synthetic waveforms to investigate how well Rayleigh wave attenuation can be recovered using an array-based wavefront-tracking approach (Russell \u0026amp; Dalton, 2022).\nFigure 1: Geographical information about our Alaska Rayleigh wave data set. (a) Locations of 383 earthquakes used to generate the Rayleigh wave data set. (b) Back-azimuthal distribution of the earthquake data set. (c) Topographic map of Alaska with 252 seismic stations shown as inverted black triangles. We measured a data set of the amplitudes and travel times of fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves generated by global earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 6 and recorded at 252 stations deployed in Alaska between 2016 and 2021. We have identified three possible sources of error in attenuation results obtained with the wavefront-tracking approach. We designed tests that make use of synthetic waveforms to explore each one.\nOvertone Interference # We seek to measure the attenuation of a fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave, but when an earthquake occurs, it excites not only the fundamental mode but also other seismic phases, including Rayleigh wave overtones. If the overtone arrives at the same time as the fundamental mode, the travel time and amplitude measurements will reflect the interference of the two seismic phases. Hariharan et al. (2020) demonstrated that overtone interference could be minimized by limiting the epicentral distance between earthquake and station to between 20-120 degrees. While we make use of this recommendation to select our earthquake data set, some overtone interference likely remains. To understand what impact such overtone interference would have on attenuation recovery, we conduct a synthetic test in a 1D Earth model with a normal-mode summation method of generating synthetic seismograms.\nFigure 2: Set-up for overtone interference test. (a) Earthquake locations are red stars, and the center of the station array in the western U.S. is shown with the blue star. (b) Locations of stations covering the western U.S. used in the test. (c) Figure 9a of Hariharan et al. (2020) showing synthetic vertical component waveforms that were calculated with normal-mode summation. Red traces are calculated with only the fundamental mode, and the grey traces contain the fundamental mode and overtones and are magnified by a factor of 5 to facilitate a visual comparison. The test set-up is summarized in Figure 2. The test location is the western U.S., and we generalize the results to Alaska. We generate two sets of synthetics, one that contains only the fundamental mode, and one that contains all modes (i.e., the fundamental mode and overtones). The difference in the recovered attenuation between these two synthetic data sets reflects the bias introduced due to overtone interference. Figure 3 shows the result of this test on a color scale set to a conservative estimate of attenuation variations in Alaska. A clear pattern of attenuation artifacts is observed when the synthetic seismograms contain overtones. However, within the context of variations in attenuation we might expect in Alaska, these artifacts should not impact recovery of dominant patterns in attenuation.\nFigure 3: Effect of overtone interference. (a) Input Rayleigh wave attenuation (1/Q) at a period of 41 s. (b) Rayleigh wave attenuation recovered when using measurements from fundamental-mode only synthetics. (c) Rayleigh wave attenuation recovered when using measurements from synthetics that contain the fundamental mode and overtones. Color bar is set to an estimate of the range in attenuation expected in a tectonically complex location like Alaska. Back-azimuthal Coverage # Our wavefront-tracking approach to solving for attenuation maps relies on having uniform azimuthal coverage of earthquakes, i.e., that a seismic station records Rayleigh waves arriving from all directions. However, the azimuthal distribution of earthquakes in our Alaska data set is uneven (Figure 1b). To investigate the uncertainty introduced by imperfect azimuthal coverage, we conduct a synthetic test with waveforms generated using a spectral element method, SPECFEM3D_GLOBE (Komatitsch et al. 2016). We use a 3D Earth model, S40RTS (Ritsema et al. 2011), and a 1D attenuation model, PREM (Dziewonski \u0026amp; Anderson 1981). Twenty-four earthquakes (Figure 4) are distributed evenly around the western U.S., which is the setting for the synthetic test; results are generalized to Alaska. To isolate the impact of uneven azimuthal coverage, we compare the attenuation recovered with this best-case even azimuthal distribution of earthquakes and with an azimuthal distribution that is more characteristic of Alaska.\nFigure 4: Set-up for azimuthal distribution test. (a) Locations of synthetic earthquakes, which reflect a best-case azimuthal distribution with 24 evenly spaced earthquakes shown as blue dots. The center of the station array in the western U.S. is plotted as a star. (b) Back-azimuthal distribution of Alaska earthquake data set, as shown in Figure 1b. (c) Subset of the 24 synthetic earthquakes that reflect the azimuthal distribution of the Alaska data set. To emulate the azimuthal distribution of the Alaska dataset, we remove events corresponding to bins in (b) with fewer than 10 earthquakes. Figure 5 shows the results of this test. We expect to recover a constant value of attenuation across the study area, and we do when the best-case azimuthal coverage is used. However, with the Alaska-type azimuthal coverage, there are artifacts in the recovered attenuation maps. As with the artifacts introduced by overtone interference, these would not entirely overwhelm the signal of large regional attenuation patterns, but they would hamper a robust quantitative interpretation of the results. In Figure 5d, we summarize period-dependent attenuation recovery using the average value calculated from the 2D map at each period. The Alaska-type azimuthal coverage introduces bias into the recovered average attenuation. These large uncertainties would limit an interpretation of attenuation maps in terms of the thermodynamic state of the mantle.\nFigure 5: Effect of azimuthal distribution. (a) Expected Rayleigh wave attenuation at a period of 73 s over the station array area. (b) Recovered Rayleigh wave attenuation when the best-case azimuthal distribution of earthquakes is used (as in Figure 4a). (c) Recovered Rayleigh wave attenuation when the Alaska-type azimuthal coverage is used (as in Figure 4c). (d) Rayleigh wave attenuation recovery over the period range 20-150s. The value at a given period reflects the average attenuation recovered over the array area. Expected 1/Q in black, recovered with best-case event distribution in red, and recovery with AK-type distribution in blue. Seismic Station Array Spacing # Rayleigh wave amplitudes contain contributions not just from attenuation, but also from the earthquake source, the receiver, and elastic focusing during propagation, which is a consequence of wavefronts bending as they propagate through heterogeneous media. Although our wavefront-tracking approach is designed to account for focusing effects on wave amplitudes, the approach is limited by the seismic station array geometry. An array with dense station spacing should be able to capture more wavefield complexity than an array of sparse stations. The EarthScope Transportable Array provided good station coverage across Alaska, with a spacing of around 70 km. However, previous studies of the elastic structure of the subsurface, such as shear wave tomography models, suggest strong focusing effects may be present in the region due to structures such as the subducting Pacific and Yakutat slabs in the south.\nFigure 6: Set-up for station density test. (a) Station array in the western U.S. used for the synthetic test. Stations are placed 10 km apart to reflect the best-case array geometry. Background colors show phase velocity at a period of 55 s calculated for the 3D Earth model (S40RTS; Ritsema et al. 2011). (b) Actual USArray station coverage in Alaska, as in Figure 1c. (c) Station array in the same location as (a) but with a station spacing of 70 km to reflect the station spacing in Alaska. To test the impact of station spacing on attenuation recovery, we set up a test similar to that for azimuthal distribution. We use the best-case earthquake set up (24 events evenly distributed around the western U.S.), but generate two sets of synthetic seismograms, one recorded at an array with 10-km station spacing and one with 70-km spacing (Figure 6).\nFigure 7: Effect of station density. (a) Expected Rayleigh wave attenuation at a period of 73 s over the station array area. (b) Recovered Rayleigh wave attenuation with the best-case station spacing of 10 km (as in Figure 6a). (c) Recovered Rayleigh wave attenuation with the Alaska-type station spacing (as in Figure 6c). (d) Rayleigh wave attenuation recovery over the period range 20-150 s. The value at a given period reflects the average attenuation recovered over the array area. Expected 1/Q in black, recovered with best-case 10 km station spacing in red, and recovery with AK-type array geometry in blue. The results are summarized in Figure 7. We observe comparable attenuation recovery and uncertainty with both station array setups. However, we are skeptical that this test tells the whole story. The 3D Earth model used, S40RTS (Ritsema et al., 2011), provides lateral heterogeneity up to spherical harmonic degree 40. This enforces a certain level of smoothness within the velocity model, and regional models of the western U.S. show greater elastic heterogeneity. Further testing is required to determine if the available station array geometry in Alaska can sufficiently recover elastic focusing effects.\nReferences # Dziewonski, A.M., Anderson, D.L., 1981.

(“Teleseismic” = from earthquakes that are far away from our sensors, “body waves” = seismic waves that dive deep into the Earth’s interior before coming back up to our stations at a steep angle, in contrast to “surface waves” that roll along the Earth’s surface.) Alaska was chosen by the iSTRUM team as a focus site because it provides a useful combination of Earth forcings at different timescales (including glacial and seasonal) as well as excellent seismological coverage. It also includes a large range in physical characteristics (e.g., temperature, melt) associated with the Pacific-North American plate boundary, that make it an ideal natural laboratory for exploring the relationship among state variables, mechanical behavior, and geophysical observables.\nAll available broadband seismic stations in Alaska between 2013 and 2022. The inset represents all the teleseismic events with magnitudes between 6 and 8 that occurred during the same period of time. Seismic attenuation, or the rate-of-loss-of-seismic-energy, is quantified by the quality factor, \\(Q\\), which describes what fraction of a wave’s energy is lost per wave cycle; higher \\(Q\\) means less attenuation. Since energy is lost each cycle, as the rocks strain one way, then the other, higher frequency waves attenuate more than lower frequency waves (even assuming \\(Q\\) itself is not frequency dependent; we don’t actually assume this but correct for slight frequency dependence observed in lab settings: \\(Q = Q_0 f^{0.27}\\)) because for a given distance traveled, higher frequencies have more wave cycles. This is very useful because it predicts a (roughly) linear dependence of wave amplitude as a function of frequency, where the gradient of the amplitude spectrum is proportional to a quantity called \\(t^\\ast\\), which is itself proportional to attenuation (i.e., \\(1/Q\\)). \\(t^\\ast\\) (pronounced “t-star”) is a canonical measurement of integrated body wave attenuation.\nUCSB grad student Cristhian Salas-Pazmino has measured differential \\(t^\\ast\\), the difference between apparent \\(t^\\ast\\) at different stations, for 14,402 P-waves and 11,297 S-waves, as well as differential travel times for 67,671 P-waves and 114,205 S-waves. P-waves have sensitivity to both shear and bulk attenuation and elastic moduli, while S-waves are sensitive only to shear attenuation and modulus.\nLeft: differential travel time measurements for S-waves Right: differential \\(t^\\ast\\) measurements for S-waves. For illustrative purposes, we defined eight bins with ranges of back azimuths every 45 degrees starting at 0 degrees. The spikes represent the mean value of all the measurements within each back azimuth bin. The measurements are colored-coded by the measured value of differential travel times and differential \\(t^\\ast\\) respectively. In the case of velocity, blue measurements represent fast arrivals and red colored spikes represent slow arrivals or positive values. In the case of attenuation, orange colors and positive values represent high attenuation, and green colors and negative values represent low attenuation. Using these measurements, we have conducted tomographic imaging, building 3-D models of wave speed and attenuation structure beneath the entirety of Alaska. Along the way, we found it necessary to implement significant methodological developments, including multi-frequency travel time measurements for finite-frequency kernels that don’t alias important structural wavelengths, and an iterative inversion for \\(\\delta(1/Q)\\) that allows for significant excursions from a 3-D global starting model. Future imaging improvements will fold in constraints from surface waves (from the Dalton group at Brown) and local body waves (from other collaborators).\nTop: Horizontal slices of our preferred S-wave model for velocity (left), and attenuation (right) at 280 km depth. Bottom: Vertical slices through the velocity (left) and attenuation (right) tomography models, the location of these slices is displayed in the middle panel The final stage of our analysis is to interpret our 3-D maps of shear velocity and attenuation for material properties, chiefly temperature, grain size, and melt fraction. We do this using the VBRc (Very Broadband Rheology calculator). We first pre-compute lookup tables that link seismic properties to these state variables, and then use a multi-stage Bayesian approach (also novel) to quantify the most likely material properties. In detail, we first compute posterior probabilities for state variables at each node in our model space with broad priors, then stitch these point-wise distributions together using a smoothing function in 2-D, then re-compute the posteriors using more narrow priors centered on the smoothed maps. The result is a set of probabilistic maps that simultaneously respect both local and regional constraints on these state variables including temperature (\\(T\\)), melt fraction (\\(\\phi\\)), and grain size (\\(d\\)),\nThermodynamic state of the upper mantle beneath Alaska.

We invite contributions from the seismology, geodesy, rock mechanics, and geodynamics communities (relevant to any space and timescale!) which shed light on understanding Earth’s transient mechanical behavior.\u0026rdquo;\nE-lightning Session ( program link)\nWednesday, 13 December 2023, 12:20 - 13:50\neLightning Theater VI, Hall D - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\nPoster Session ( program link)\nWednesday, 13 December 2023, 16:10 - 20:30\nPoster Hall A-C - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\niSTRUM-related Presentations # Spatiotemporal Sea-Level Fingerprinting of Meltwater Pulse 1A with Transient Deformation ( program link) Allie Coonin, Harriet Lau, Sophie Coulson Monday, December 11, 11:40 - 11:50\n2005 - West (Level 2, West, Moscone Center)\nA Dynamic Oceanic Asthenosphere Revealed by High Shear Attenuation in the Pacific ( program link) Josh Russell, Colleen Dalton, Chris Havlin, Ben Holtzman, Zachary Eilon, James Gaherty, Don Forsyth\nMonday, December 11, 16:10 - 20:30\nPoster Hall A-C - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\nMelting ice, rising land: unraveling contributions to crustal uplift imaged by Sentinel-1 InSAR in the Kerguelen Islands ( program link) Kristel Chanard, Raphael Grandin, Louis-Marie Gauer, Luce Fleitout\nMonday, December 11, 18:50 - 19:00\n158 - South (Upper Mezzanine, South, Moscone Center)\nTowards Quantitative Understanding of the Effect of Dislocations on Ice Anelasticity: High-Resolution Measurements of Attenuation and Dispersion with a New Cryo-Forced-Oscillation Apparatus ( program link)\nHatsuki Yamauchi, Christine McCarthy, Benjamin K Holtzman, Travis F Hager, David L Goldsby\nWednesday, December 13, 10:30 - 14:50\nPoster Hall A-C - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\nEstimating the Electrical Resistivity of the Upper Mantle with the Very Broadband Rheology Calculator (VBRc) ( program link) Samuel Ofori, Samer Naif, Chris Havlin, Benjamin K Holtzman\nWednesday, December 13, 10:30 - 14:50 Poster Hall A-C - South (Exhibition Level, South, Moscone Center)\n","date":"October 17, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/agu-2023/","section":"","summary":"iSTRUM-related sessions and presentations at the AGU Fall Meeting, 2023","title":"AGU Preview","type":"blog"},{"content":" iSTRUM Meeting Recap # In early September, the iSTRUM team convened its first in-person team meeting to cap off a year full of discussion and collaboration on linking observational geophysics, laboratory experiments and forward modeling to better constrain the role of transient rheology in the deformation of the upper mantle. Over two days at Brown University in Providence RI, team members and a number of invited guests presented their efforts to constrain, observe and model the full spectrum rheology of the upper mantle.\nDay 1 of the meeting included a number of presentations from team members including updates on new deformation experiments on both olivine (Lars Hansen and Diede Hein, U. Minnesota) and ice (Ben Holtzman and Hatsuki Yamauchi, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) as well as approaches to modeling that incorporate more complex constitutive relationships (Harriet Lau, Brown U.). On the observational side, Kristel Chanard (IPGP) presented results from initial efforts to decompose geodetic observations in the western US to identify a signal from transient deformation. Zach Eilon and Cristhian Salas Pazmiño (UC Santa Barbara) presented differential body wave attenuation results from both Alaska and the Western US, and Josh Russell (Syracuse U.) presented his results on the seismic attenuation of the Pacific upper mantle, on which Colleen Dalton (Brown U.) is a collaborator.\nThe second day of the meeting focused on discussion and planning for the main goal of the iSTRUM project in which laboratory, observational and modeling efforts are integrated within a single modeling framework and applied to the selected sites (Western US, Alaska, Iceland). Some of the action items for the upcoming year include developing constitutive equations based on experimental data that can be used within the Very Broadband Rheology Calculator (VBRc); developing strategies for including a more complex nonlinear transient rheology in forward models of GIA and other surface loading problems; modeling glacial isostatic adjustment using the open source geodynamic finite element model ASPECT; and reconciling body wave and surface wave measurements of attenuation in the western US and Alaska. All of these efforts will feed into the main short-term goal of linking seismic, geodetic, lake rebound and GIA data from the western US within an initial pilot study that relies on the updated VBRc to constrain both the thermodynamic state of the upper mantle and the contribution of transient deformation to those observations. The methodology developed in the pilot study will then be applied across the chosen study regions.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in learning more, come find us at AGU!\n","date":"October 1, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/istrum-yr1-recap/","section":"","summary":"In early September, the iSTRUM team convened its first in-person team meeting to cap off a year full of discussion and collaboration on linking observational geophysics, laboratory experiments and forward modeling to better constrain the role of transient rheology in the deformation of the upper mantle.

You can write and submit posts in the following ways:\nwrite a new post in a github issue write a new post in a github pull request write a new post and send the markdown file and images to Chris submission via issue # Start a new issue and title it New Post: \u0026lt;your title\u0026gt;. Write your post directly in the issue! You can upload images and write in standard markdown. When ready, click Submit New Issue and a maintainer will help to get port the post over to a pull request.\ntop\nsubmission via pull request # Fork the repository and clone it locally.\nEach blog post has its own folder in /content/blog/. Once the markdown folder is merged into the github repository, it will automatically get picked up and rendered. So to write a new post, you need to:\ncreate a new branch for your post: $ git branch -b my_new_post add a new folder to /content/blog/, for example: /content/blog/my_new_post/ add a new index.md file in your new folder. Note that this files requires a particular style of markdown preamble. write your post in the markdown file. commit your index.md (and any image files that you added). push your branch to your fork and open a pull request! top\nsubmission via email # Write your markdown post then email (or attach in a slack message) the markdown file and any image files to Chris.\ntop\nWriting your markdown post # Your blog post should be written in a single plain text markdown file. If you are submitting via pull request, you should name that file index.md in the correct directory. Otherwise, you can name it anything you want with a .md extension, and it will be renamed to index.md on final upload to the website\u0026rsquo;s repository.\nYour markdown file will consist of 2 general sections: the preamble and body. The preamble includes a bit of markdown code related to how the website picks up posts during rendering while the body is where your post goes.\nmarkdown preamble for posts # For a new post to get picked up, the index.md must have a particular block of code called the preamble. At the top of the index.md file, paste the following and edit:\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Your blog post title!\u0026#34; date = \u0026#34;2020-11-14\u0026#34; +++ And that\u0026rsquo;s it!

The rate of this flow depends on the properties of the rock, such as its temperature, and on the nature of the contacts between the tiny mineral crystals that comprise the rock. The mantle can be pushed to flow by numerous different phenomena, such as: passing seismic waves after an earthquake; melting of continental ice sheets and glaciers; the annual cycle of groundwater recharge and extraction; and the draining of large lakes. This study uses observations of these phenomena to measure the rock properties and the interactions between mineral crystals in the mantle beneath three locations: the western United States, Alaska, and Iceland. Meanwhile, laboratory experiments are probing how samples of rock deform under controlled conditions. Finally, new computer models are synthesizing the lab and field observations to understand the underlying physical laws that explain the full suite of data. The results of this study have a bearing on topics that range from predicting how sea level will rise due to melting ice sheets to understanding tidal deformation on Jupiter’s moons. Outreach and training are key elements of the project. Four graduate students and six undergraduate students are being educated over the duration of the project. Workshops will bring together researchers from diverse scientific disciplines to learn and debate about the scientific outcomes and the computer tools developed as part of this study.\nThere is emerging recognition that the variables describing Earth’s mechanical response to stress, elastic moduli, attenuation, and viscosity, are all frequency dependent. While the end-member elastic and steady-state behaviors are relatively well understood, there remain many fundamental questions regarding the intermediate transient regime. This study is an integrative research and outreach program that combines observational, laboratory, and modeling efforts to measure Earth’s full-spectrum rheological response and illuminate the underlying microphysical processes. Observational work is characterizing frequency dependent upper-mantle dissipation in three locations (western U.S., Iceland, and Alaska) using seismic and geodetic observations of different frequencies but complementary spatial sampling. Experimental work is investigating how dislocations affect transient creep under different temperature and stress conditions and with variable quantities of melt and secondary solid phases. Modeling work is developing new constitutive laws for transient creep and incorporating more sophisticated rheologies in the viscoelastic deformation code. This study is addressing questions about: (1) the broadband mechanical response of the solid Earth; (2) the microphysical processes that control viscoelasticity; and (3) the implications for inferences of steady-state viscosity from geodetic observations and of thermodynamic state from seismic tomography. Broader impacts include training of graduate and undergraduate students, a synthesis workshop that convenes 120 researchers to outline recent advances in understanding transient rheology and to shape the topics and collaborations that will dictate the next decade of inquiry, and development of interactive Jupyter notebooks that introduce open-source data-science tools in the context of seismic attenuation and transient rheology.\nProject leads # iSTRUM brings together researchers from across geoscience disciplines through support of the NSF Frontier Research in Earth Sciences program.
