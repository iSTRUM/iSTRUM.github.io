There are two ways to write and submit a new post: via github issues or via a github pull request.\nsubmission via issue Start a new issue and title it New Post: \u0026lt;your title\u0026gt;. Write your post directly in the issue! You can upload images and write in standard markdown. When ready, click Submit New Issue and a maintainer will help to get port the post over to a pull request.\ntop\nsubmission via pull request Fork the repository and clone it locally.\nEach blog post has its own folder in /content/blog/. Once the markdown folder is merged into the github repository, it will automatically get picked up and rendered. So to write a new post, you need to:\ncreate a new branch for your post: $ git branch -b my_new_post add a new folder to /content/blog/ add two files: index.md and content.md. Note that both files rely on markdown headers in a particular syntax (see the following section) write your post. commit your .md (and any image files that you added). push your branch to your fork and open a pull request! top\nmarkdown header for a new post to get picked up, both the index.md and content.md file have to have a proper header. At the top of the index.md file, paste the following and edit:\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Your blog post title!\u0026#34; date = \u0026#34;2020-11-14\u0026#34; +++ The rest of this file will always remain blank.\nAt the top of content.md add:\n+++ fragment = \u0026#34;content\u0026#34; weight = 100 summary = \u0026#34;Overview of how to submit new blog posts.\u0026#34; date = \u0026#34;2022-11-14\u0026#34; +++ The summary entry will be displayed at https://istrum.github.io/blog . Make the date field match the index.md file. Do not edit the fragment or weight fields.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to write your post in content.md.\nNote that if you\u0026rsquo;re new to markdown, you can also look at the source code for this post to see some examples for headers, links and more.\ntop\nIncluding images To include images that exist somewhere on the web, you can use\n![Alt text](https://www.yoururl.com/nice.png \u0026#34;a title\u0026#34;) If you are writing your blog post locally to submit as a pull request, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a couple extra steps. First create a folder in /static/images/blog/ for your post and add your images to that folder. Then to embed the images in the markdown, you\u0026rsquo;ll reference the images with:\n![Alt text](/images/blog/your_post/figure_1.png \u0026#34;a title\u0026#34;) Note that the image path must start with /images/, not /static/. For example, for this post, there is a corresponding folder, static/images/blog/submitting-posts/ where the VBRsimpleFlowchart.png figure exists. To add it here:\n![flow chart showing the VBRc](/images/blog/submitting-posts/VBRsimpleFlowchart.png \u0026#34;VBRc flowchart\u0026#34;) top\nIncluding math The blog allows mathjax expressions (very similar to latex). Note that if you\u0026rsquo;re writing your post as a github issue, the math will not render in preview mode.\nFor equation blocks, you wrap with $$.\nfor example\n$$ x = \\phi $$\nrenders as\n$$ x = \\phi $$\nFor multi-line, aligned equations use eqnarray with \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; to align around the =. Separate lines with \\\\\\\\:\n$$ \\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{\\partial{T}}{\\partial{t}} + V \\cdot \\nabla{T} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\kappa \\nabla ^2 T \\\\\\\\ \\rho \\frac{DV}{Dt} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; - \\nabla p + \\eta \\nabla^2 + \\rho g \\\\\\\\ \\nabla \\cdot {V} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\\\ \\end{eqnarray} $$ renders as\n$$ \\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{\\partial{T}}{\\partial{t}} + V \\cdot \\nabla{T} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\kappa \\nabla ^2 T \\\\ \\rho \\frac{DV}{Dt} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; - \\nabla p + \\eta \\nabla^2 + \\rho g \\\\ \\nabla \\cdot {V} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{eqnarray} $$\nFor inline equations, use \\\\( and \\\\). So \\\\(x=\\phi\\\\) will render as \\(x=\\phi\\).\ntop\nTesting the web-rendering locally If you want to see what your new post will look like when it\u0026rsquo;s fully rendered, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to set up a development environment for the blog.\nFirst, install hugo extended edition following instructions at gohuo.io (note that the hugo theme we use here requires the extended, not the standard hugo!).\nNow, fork https://github.com/iSTRUM/iSTRUM.github.io and clone your fork locally, being sure to enable initialize submodules:\n$ git clone --recurse-submodules git://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/iSTRUM.github.io.git Now you should be able to locally build and serve the full website with:\n$ cd iSTRUM.github.io $ hugo server after which the website should be avaialbe to view at http://localhost:1313.\ntop\n","permalink":"https://iSTRUM.github.io/blog/submitting-posts/","tags":null,"title":"Instructions for blog submissions"},{"categories":null,"contents":"iSTRUM.github.io is live!\n","permalink":"https://iSTRUM.github.io/blog/hello-world/","tags":null,"title":"Hello world!"},{"categories":null,"contents":"words go here.\n","permalink":"https://iSTRUM.github.io/about/","tags":null,"title":"About Syna"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"https://iSTRUM.github.io/","tags":null,"title":"iSTRUM"}]
